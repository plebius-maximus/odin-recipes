        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <p>I used to love eating scrambled eggs as a kid. That is, until I actually learned what eggs were and where they came from… My relationship with eggs was officially tainted forever. The joy I felt eating scrambled eggs is something I still miss, which is where this Easy Tofu Scramble comes in. It’s a vegan egg recipe that really hits the spot. Slightly creamy and jammy with some seriously delicious eggy flavors, it’s as close to real scrambled eggs as it gets! And as the best tofu scramble recipe ever, it only takes 10 minutes to cook a batch in one pan. The ingredients are simple and likely already in your kitchen, too! I highly recommend doubling the recipe so you have enough for yourself, the kids, and leftovers for a few days after.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>14.5-ounce block firm tofu</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons nutritional yeast</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon kala namak (black salt) or more to taste</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon turmeric</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons non-dairy milk, unsweetened and unflavored</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Method</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Heat the olive oil in a pan over medium heat (I prefer a cast iron pan, or non-stick). Mash the block of tofu right in the pan, with a potato masher or a fork. You can also crumble it into the pan with your hands. Cook, stirring frequently, for 3-4 minutes until the water from the tofu is mostly gone.
            </li>
            <li>Now add the nutritional yeast, salt, turmeric and garlic powder. Cook and stir constantly for about 5 minutes. Continue to cook for longer, not stirring for a few minutes at a time, until golden spots form on some of the tofu. This is a personal preference but I prefer some golden spots and a longer cook time.
            </li>
            <li>Pour the non-dairy milk into the pan, and stir to mix. Serve immediately with sliced avocado, hot sauce, parsley, steamed kale, toast or any other breakfast item.
            </li>
        </ol>
